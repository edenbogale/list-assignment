# List Operations Assignment

This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates basic list operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and searching elements in a list.

## 📝 Assignment Requirements
The program performs the following steps:
1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Appends the values: 10, 20, 30, 40.
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position (index 1).
4. Extends the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element from the list.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30`.

## 🖥️ Output
When `main.py` is run, the output will be:
The index of 30 is: 3
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
